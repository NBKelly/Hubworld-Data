### WHAT IS THIS
This is my attempt to keep track of the data required for Hubworld: Aidalon. This is based off of the Netrunner-Data repo, by NoahTheDuke - see: https://github.com/noahTheDuke/netrunner-data

Currently, this scrapes a website for relevant information, then compiles that into data files, which can then be imported into the hubworld repo.
